# Multi-Vendor Comparison Guidelines

## Comparison Methodology

When multiple vendor options are available, compare on:
1. **Equipment suitability** (BTU capacity match)
2. **Customer pricing** (primary decision factor)
3. **Equipment specifications** (secondary considerations)

## Pricing Comparison

### Customer Price Calculation

All vendors use same markup:
```
Customer Price = Vendor Cost × 1.25
Markup Amount = Customer Price - Vendor Cost
```

### Presentation Format

Show both vendor and customer pricing for transparency:

```
Vendor A:
  Vendor Cost: $3,795
  Customer Price: $4,744
  Markup: $949

Vendor B:
  Vendor Cost: $3,950
  Customer Price: $4,938
  Markup: $988
  
SAVINGS with Vendor A: $194
```

## Equipment Comparison Factors

### Primary: BTU Match Quality

**Scenario 1: Both meet requirements similarly**
```
Required: 8,000 BTU

Vendor A: 9,888 BTU (24% over) - $4,744
Vendor B: 9,500 BTU (19% over) - $4,800

Recommendation: Vendor A (lower price, both adequate)
```

**Scenario 2: One is better sized**
```
Required: 8,000 BTU

Vendor A: 9,888 BTU (24% over) - $4,744
Vendor B: 8,200 BTU (3% over) - $4,900

Consideration: Vendor B better sized but $156 more
Recommendation: Customer choice, note sizing difference
```

### Secondary: Equipment Features

Consider when prices are very close (<5% difference):

**Horsepower:**
- Lower HP = lower operating cost
- Important for high-usage applications

**Evaporator type:**
- ADR (coolers) vs LED (freezers) - correct type is critical
- LED provides better visibility (lighting included)

**Compressor type:**
- Scroll compressors more efficient (models with "A" suffix)
- Reciprocating compressors more affordable

**Generation:**
- Newer models may have better efficiency
- Digital controllers (C suffix) vs older controls

💡 RECOMMENDATION: Turbo Air
   - $69 less than ABCO option
   - Both systems adequately sized
   - Turbo Air has slightly higher capacity
```

### Price Difference Matrix

When showing multiple options:

```
Price Comparison:
                    Customer Price    vs Lowest
Turbo Air           $4,744           —
ABCO                $4,813           +$69 (+1.5%)
Vendor C (future)   $4,925           +$181 (+3.8%)
```

## Decision Framework

### Clear Winner (>5% price difference)
Recommend lower-cost option if both meet requirements.

### Close Call (2-5% price difference)
Present both options, note any equipment differences, let customer choose.

### Negligible Difference (<2%)
Recommend based on secondary factors:
- Better BTU match
- Lower horsepower
- Better warranty/support
- Customer's existing vendor relationship

### Non-Price Factors

Only override price recommendation if:
- Significant sizing difference (>20% vs <10% oversizing)
- Reliability/warranty concerns
- Customer specifically requests certain vendor

## Special Situations

### One Vendor Missing Equipment

```
Required: 15,000 BTU, 2 evaporators

Turbo Air: Available
  System: 16,540 BTU, dual coils
  Price: $8,500

ABCO: No dual-coil system available
  Best option: 18,000 BTU single coil
  Price: $7,200
  Note: Single coil inadequate for box size

RECOMMENDATION: Turbo Air
  - Only vendor with proper dual-coil configuration
  - Price not comparable due to different specifications
```

### Significantly Different Capacities

```
Required: 8,000 BTU

Vendor A: 9,888 BTU (24% over) - $4,744
Vendor B: 12,000 BTU (50% over) - $4,600

RECOMMENDATION: Vendor A
  - Better sized despite higher price
  - Vendor B significantly oversized (short cycling risk)
  - $144 difference justified by better performance
```

## Customer Communication

### Emphasize Value, Not Just Price

**Good:**
"Turbo Air provides the best value with properly sized equipment 
at the lowest customer price of $4,744. The system provides 
27% capacity margin for reliable operation."

**Avoid:**
"Turbo Air is cheapest at $4,744."

### Explain Equipment Differences

When prices are close, explain WHY options differ:

"Both vendors provide 1 HP systems meeting your requirements:
- Turbo Air: 9,888 BTU capacity, $4,744 (better sized)
- ABCO: 12,000 BTU capacity, $4,813 (more oversized)

The $69 difference is minimal. Turbo Air's better sizing may 
provide more consistent temperatures, while ABCO's extra 
capacity offers additional margin."

### Present Choice Clearly

```
RECOMMENDATION: Turbo Air ($4,744)

However, ABCO option available at $4,813 (+$69, 1.5% more)
Both options meet your requirements.

Would you like to proceed with Turbo Air, or would you 
prefer ABCO for any specific reason?
```

## Future Considerations

As more vendors are added:
- Maintain same comparison format
- Scale to 3+ vendor comparisons
- Consider vendor reliability data
- Track customer preferences
- Note delivery times if significant
